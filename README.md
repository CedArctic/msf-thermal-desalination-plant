# Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) Desalination Plant

## Overview

Desalination is the process of converting high salinity sea water into potable water. This full-order model has been developed, tested, and validated against real plant data obtained from the Khubar II MSF plant in Saudi Arabia, as presented in the corresponding publications \[1\] \[2\] \[3\]. The model is a 22 stage MSF desalination plant, which consists of 3 Heat Rejection Sections and 19 Heat Recovery Sections. It also consists of 4 flow rate, 3 level, 3 temperature, 1 pressure sensor, 2 gas valves, 9 liquid valves, and 3 PI controllers. The base simulation is modified to include support for Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL).

## Requirements

Windows OS<br />
MATLAB<br />
Simulink-RealTime

## Instructions

1. Change the HIL bit to **0** for using Simulink and **1** to enable HIL. Set to **0** by default.
